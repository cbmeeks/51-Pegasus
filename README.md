## Sublime Text 2 and Kick Assembler

I'm a big fan of Sublime Text 2 and Kick Assembler for my Commodore 64 assembly programming.

I've created a custom build system for Sublime Text 2 (ST2) that automatically builds the `.asm` file in the editor to a *.prg, and launches Vice if you have it configured to open `.prg` files.

You can find the gist here:
